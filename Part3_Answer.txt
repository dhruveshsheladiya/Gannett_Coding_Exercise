I believe that We can use Jenkins or any tool for creating Continuous Integration Pipelines.

Jenkins is an open-source continuous integration (CI) tool that helps orchestrate the development processes (build, test, and deployment) with automation. In other words, Jenkins is one of the leading tools that would help a development team industrialize its processes. This is the developerâ€™s teammate, whom you can ask to put your code into production (or staging) when you push code on specific branches (master and develop).
