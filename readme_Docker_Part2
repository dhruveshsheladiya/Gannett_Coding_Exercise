readme {Docker} Part-2

To run API on Docker we need Docker Toolbox installed in our machine. After installing docker toolbox check "docker --version" to check docker installed successfully or not.

1. try to run Hello world Image in docker using "docker run hello-world"

2. If your hello-world file runs successfully then docker would have generated hello-world image file. 

3. You can check if image generated or not by "docker image ls" or "docker images" you will see hello-world image created.

4. Now you need dockerfile and requirements.txt, So create empty directory and move dockerfile and requirement.txt to that directory.

5. Give "docker version" to activate the Docker 

6. Give "docker build -t friendlyHello ." don't forget space and then after dot "." after image name.

7. Your image would be generated, check using "docker image ls" 

8. To run the API give command "docker run -p 8000:80 friendlyHello". Server would be started on http://127.0.0.1:8000
